Then, the next morning, while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess.

Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.",
